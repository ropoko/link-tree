# link-tree

Script that iterate over the links found in each page, recursively finding more and more links, and at the end print in format of a tree.

##  example: 

```text
  -> https://ropoko.net/
  # | -- https://ropoko.net/projects
  # | -- https://ropoko.net/about
  # | -- https://ropoko.net/tags
  # | -- https://ropoko.net/posts/firstPost
```

## TODO
- [ ] Iterate over children
- [ ] Use recursion
- [ ] Better filtering of links
- [ ] Set a limit number of recursion
